<h1>My Hobbies:</h1>
<p>
    I enjoy filmmaking as a hobby, 
    which allows me to explore creativity and express stories through visual media.
    Working on short films and video projects teaches me patience, attention to detail, and how to bring ideas to life.

<p>
    Apart from filmmaking,
    I love photography and traveling.
    Capturing moments through the lens and exploring new places broadens my perspective and inspires me in both personal and professional projects.
    I also enjoy reading and learning new skills to keep myself curious and motivated.
